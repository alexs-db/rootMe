Steganography  is a complex domain to understand.

For this challenge, I will not tell you a lot about the logic to have, because If you know how the data is store for images files you will not have a big difficulty to find the flag.

The only thing I can give to you, is a tool available on many operating system called "ExifTool".
You will follow the installation process on Internet.

Good luck !
