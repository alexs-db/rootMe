This challenge is similar to the first one.

You have a text and you don't know what to do with that.

I can't give you all the way to follow but I use personally a tool called "Steghide" use to hide text in a file (image or sound).

Install it with the procedure available on the internet and have fun !

Warning : For Mac users you can use FindEye (an alternative to Steghide not available on Mac OS), you can also use Kali Linux.
