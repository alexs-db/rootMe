We have a PDF that certainly carries a hidden object with it.

I decide to open it with "peepdf" to analyze it

>peepdf -i in interactive mode
PPDF>open /home/..../file.pdf (enter your path to the file here)

The file opens and displays the following information

PPDF> info

'
.......

'


After that I will let you think about a last little manipulation to do.

Ps : Look after 'object' maybe around 77 or 78 ;)
