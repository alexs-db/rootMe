For this challenge you can't use directly WireShark.

You have a ethernet frame, I gave it to you. 

You have a free file on RootMe which explain you how are make frames (how the data is stored with the octets...)

After that you have to convert the frame in text. Don't forget to have a look on how your flag is encode after convert the frame. 

Good Luck !
