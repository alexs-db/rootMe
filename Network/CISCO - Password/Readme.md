This challenge's goal is to learn about CISCO  password configurations.

Here you have to find the "enable" password. You will find it easily.

After that you will see with the help of the free files on the subject that the password is too hard to be decode.

So for that I will give you a little clue :

Have a look at this lines : 

"username hub password 7 025017705B3907344E 
username admin privilege 15 password 7 10181A325528130F010D24
username guest password 7 124F163C42340B112F3830"

And try to find a logic between this three lines and the flag to find.

Good luck !
