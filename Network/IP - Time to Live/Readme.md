For this one, it looks difficult but it is not.

You have a lot of ways to find the flag but I will give you the two more simple.

The first one is to look one the frame on WireShark like always, you will see at a moment the destination will have a different behavior and reply at the request look at the tll used on this line.

The second method is to go on "Statistics --> Flow Graphs" and have a look on the graph.

It have a lot of information but don't pay attention on that for the moment. Look at the behavior of the answer and request, during a lot of time you will see "no request found" but after a certain ttl you will see that this message doesn't appear anymore. Click on the line and see the respective ttl.

The flag is yours !
