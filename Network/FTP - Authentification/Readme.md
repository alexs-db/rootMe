Wireshark is a powerful network analysis tool for capturing and inspecting packets exchanged over a network.
Wireshark captures frames based on different protocols such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and TELNET (TErminal NETwork or TELecommunication NETwork).
The FTP protocol is used to transfer files between a client and a remote server.


For this challenge you had to find the FTP frame and you will obtain the flag which is the password used by the client to connecting on the server.
