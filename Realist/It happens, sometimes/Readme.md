This challenge looks hard but it's not.

I will give you a little clue : you have to fin the 'admin' section.

With the help of the documents try some things to place in the url of the challenge likes e.g : '/administration or /admin'.

After that you will have a connexion form.

For this step use the tool named Curl.

Curl (abbreviation of client URL request library: "URL request library for clients" or see URL: "see URL") is a command line interface, intended to retrieve the content of a resource accessible by a computer network.

If you don't understand search on Internet.
