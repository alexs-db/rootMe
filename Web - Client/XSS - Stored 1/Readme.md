This challenge looks difficult but it is not.

So I will not explain to you in details what is XSS attack, you have a lot of information on Internet to understand it.

If you want I can give you a clue after you understood what is XSS. You can see that with different videos but I will explain to you.

To find the vulnerable zone in your web page, you have to test if your page interpret a script that you have injected in the source code.

To do that for the moment, you have to use for example "<script>alert("Alert")</script>" for example.

After many tests you will see if a zone of the page is vulnerable in which you can inject scripts. 

The main goal of XSS attack is to intercept admin cookies and send it to a server you have created (in PHP or Python).

I can't explain you how to sent this cookies but pay attention how the admin connect to the web page.

Last thing, you have to know a little about JavaScript command (search around "document.location()" to help you)...

Good Luck !
