For this challenge I will explain to you a little bit about HTML.

In HTML we use tag to make registration form for example.

In this situation you have a very simple connection page code in HTML, but you can see there is a little problem with the input to connect to the web site and also with the button "Member Access", they are "disabled".

By the way, the only thing to do is to remove the "disabled" from the tag in the source code of the web site (which you can see when you inspect the page in a browser like Firefox, Chrome, etc...)

After this little manipulation you will obtain the flag !
