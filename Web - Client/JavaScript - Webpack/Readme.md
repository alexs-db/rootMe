For this challenge I can tell you a lot I will let you search.

But I just explain to you what is Webpack.

Webpack is a very popular build tool in modern web development. It is mainly used to bundle, transform and optimize web resources such as JavaScript, CSS styles and images. Webpack lets you create efficient bundles from modules and manage dependencies between them. This helps developers to organize and optimize their code for optimum performance when running in a web browser.

I can advise you to look at the sources codes but after use the definition here to help you if you need it !
