This challenge looks difficult but I will give you a clue to understand it.

I give to you the Java Script Source Code on the directory named "script.js".

If you didn't have understand the script, copied it and put it to an DÃ©-obfuscator on Web.

After that look at the last line of the script and deduce with the help of the others Obfuscation challenges.

GL !
