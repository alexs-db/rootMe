This challenge isn't more difficult than the HTML one.

For this one, you have to inspect the .js source code but not the HTML.

A little clue : in JS form sometimes to verify if your username and password are correct the way to do it is very basic ;).

Ps: You have to find this verification in "login.js" file with the help of "page.png" image of my directory.
