This challenge is a little bit more complex because you have any clue.

I will telling you about JavaScript Native code.

In JavaScript, "native code" refers to code written in a language other than JavaScript, such as C++ or C, which is then compiled into executable native code by the browser or JavaScript runtime environment. This native code can be called from within JavaScript using mechanisms such as application programming interfaces (APIs) or native modules. This makes it possible to improve performance or access functionalities not directly available in pure JavaScript.

I will give you an help because this is not very intuitive. As always, go the page and inspect the JS source code.

After that you will fin the script of the native code.

Then to let you search a little, try some things with the debugger and the script ! 

Good Luck :)
