This one is a little bit more complex but comprehensible for beginners.

So like the other one you have to find the .js source code file like always.

The difficulty is to decode the encode flag.

I will give you little clues :

- The function "unescape" is always.
- Be attentive to the way is encode the password.
- Don't forget any function to decode it.

You will have a start to understand how to decode but after I will let you find, otherwise it will be not funny ;)
