Principle:
An emacs backup file exists whose name is formed by adding the tilde character to the end of the original file name.

Resolution:
To view the contents of the file, use the url :
http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch11/index.php~

The code displays the username and pass; using these in the form displays a page saying that you can validate with this pass.

The pass found in the code effectively validates the challenge.
