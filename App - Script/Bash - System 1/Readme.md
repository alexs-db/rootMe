When we list the directory, we notice that we have the `s` attribute on the `ch11` executable.
This means that we launch it with the rights of the owner, which is `app-script-ch11-cracked`, i.e. the same owner as the `.passwd` file.

To run `cat` instead of `ls`, simply copy the executable into `/tmp`.

Pay attention to the environment variable.

And look at the documents you have on the subject, it's important !
