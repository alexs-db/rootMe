For this first programming challenge you have to connect with TCP on a server and execute tasks asking in the subject.

To let you make research on the web, I will only give you (if you need it), a little python program to connect on TCP to the server (help.py).

But for the last part of the challenge I will let you find the answer alone. (be careful at the end with the flag and his encoding).
