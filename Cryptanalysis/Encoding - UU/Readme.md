For this first challenge, the main goal is to understand how UU text is encoded. You need to decode this text, but for this one, you don't need a lot of tools (for the moment). You will have a .txt file to start the challenge.

You can find this file talks about encoding formats in the challenge menu.


If you'd like, you can use the information provided in the file to decode the flag. However, nowadays, a tool called 'CyberChef' exists. You can use this tool to decode the flag, which isn't very difficult.

The only difficulty is to use the good encoding flag to decode it (be careful to the syntax).
