For this first challenge, the main goal is to understand how ASCII text is encoded.
You need to decode this text, but for this one, you don't need a lot of tools (for the moment). 
You will have a .txt file to start the challenge.


You can find an ASCII table in the challenge menu.


If you'd like, you can use the information provided in the table to decode the flag.
However, nowadays, a tool called 'CyberChef' exists.
You can use this tool to decode the flag, which isn't very difficult.
