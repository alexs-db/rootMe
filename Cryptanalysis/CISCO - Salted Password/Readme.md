For this challenge you have to find the passwords for the "enable" and "administrator" password.

To find them in the file it is not very complicated !

After that you will see that the passwords are encrypted.

If you have a little knowledge in Networks and with little searches on Internet you will find how to decrypt them.

If you really don't understand, to help you I advise you to use "Hashcat" or "JohnTheRipper".

You just have to find the hash method after that.

GL!
